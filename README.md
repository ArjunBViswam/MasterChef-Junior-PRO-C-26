# How to make Black Forest cake? 

1. Preheat oven to 175 degrees Centigrade. Grease and flour two 9" cake pans or three 6" cake pans. I used three 6" cake pans.
2. Add a tablespoon of instant coffee powder to the hot water and keep aside.
3. In a large bowl, sieve the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add the sugar and mix well with the dry ingredients.
4. Make a well in the center and add the milk, oil, vanilla essence and beaten  eggs and mix. Finally add the hot coffee mixture and mix. Do not over  mix. 
5. Pour the cake batter into  the prepared cake pans and bake in the middle  rack of the oven for 40 minutes or until a skewer comes out clean. Start  checking from 35 minutes onwards.
6. Cool on a wire rack for 30 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack. Bring to  room temperature. If the cake has a dome shape, use a serrated knife and slice the dome off and level the cake till it has a flat top.
7. While the cake is cooling, prepare the whipping cream. Place a very large  bowl and beaters in the freezer for 15 minutes before beating the whipping  cream..
8. Place ice cubes in a plate. Place the cold bowl on the ice cubes and pour two cups of whipping cream in the bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at high speed until stiff peaks form, approximate 5-6 minutes. Place the whipped cream  in the fridge till you start assembling the cake.
9. Open the tinned cherries and drain the liquid (cherry syrup). Measure 1 cup  of syrup and add 3 tablespoons powdered sugar and mix. This is to reduce the  tartness of the cherry syrup. 
10. Pit 1 cup of cherries, chop into small pieces and keep aside. Reserve 1/4 cup of whole cherries for decoration.
11. To assemble the cake:
12. On a turntable, place a cake board that has been lined with shiny silver  or gold paper. Invert the cake and place it upside down on top of the  cake base so that the cake has a flat top.
13. Drizzle 5 to 6 tablespoons of cherry syrup or sugar syrup over the cake layer  covering the entire cake. Do not drizzle too much syrup as the cake  might get soggy, 
14. Using a spatula spread a cup of whipped cream . Leave a gap of 1" along the  edge of the cake. It should be a thick layer. Over the layer spread some of the chopped cherries. 
15. Place another layer of inverted cake over the first layer and repeat the same process with cherry syrup, whipped cream and chopped cherries. 
16. Finally place the inverted cake layer with the flat top and drizzle with cherry syrup all over and spread a thin layer of whipped cream on top and  along the sides of the cake. 
17. Use a cake comb along the sides and create a comb effect all around the  cake. Place the cake in the fridge for at least 2 to 3 hours at this  stage.
18. Place the remaining whipped cream in a piping bag with a star tip and place  in fridge. At the time of serving, remove the cake from the fridge and  pipe stars along the top edge of the cake and at the base of the cake as shown in the picture above.
19. Place a cherry on top of each piped out star and sprinkle grated chocolate.  You can also place chocolate shards along the sides. You can decorate as your fancy.
20. Place the cake in the fridge for at least another hour and serve. If you are  rushed for time, you can go ahead and serve the cake.
